To run this example:

Step 1: First install the Haskell Platform, which can be download from: https://www.haskell.org/platform/.

Step 2: After installing it, now you have two option to run this program, you can use WinGHCi or Command prompt.

Step 3: Using WinGHCI:
	
	a. Click on the file and choose load option and select the file "Haskell_Example" and open it.
	b. Write "run m0" and the program execution starts.

Step 4: Using Command propmt:Two ways.

	First way: a. Open the cmd and go the directory where the file "Haskell_Example" is saved.
		   b. Write "ghci".
		   c. Prelude mode then write ":l Haskell_Example".
		   d. *Main > run m0.

	Second way: a. Open the cmd and write "ghc --make Haskell_Example.hs -o main", it will create the executable file by the name "main".
		    b. To run the executable file through cmd write "main.exe" or you can go to the destination where you have saved the "Haskell_Example" file, their you will find the executable application "main" run this.
